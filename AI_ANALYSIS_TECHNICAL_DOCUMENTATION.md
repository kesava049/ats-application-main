}
```

## Scoring and Decision Making

### Overall Score Calculation

The system uses a weighted average approach to calculate the overall score:

```javascript
const overallScore = (skillsScore * 0.4) + (experienceScore * 0.35) + (culturalFitScore * 0.25);
```

**Weight Distribution:**
- **Skills Match**: 40% (Most important for technical roles)
- **Experience**: 35% (Important for seniority and leadership)
- **Cultural Fit**: 25% (Important for team integration)

### Verdict Determination

```javascript
const determineVerdict = (overallScore) => {
    if (overallScore >= 0.85) return "highly_recommended";
    if (overallScore >= 0.70) return "recommended";
    if (overallScore >= 0.50) return "consider";
    return "not_recommended";
};
```

**Verdict Thresholds:**
- **Highly Recommended**: 85%+ (Exceptional fit)
- **Recommended**: 70-84% (Strong fit)
- **Consider**: 50-69% (Moderate fit)
- **Not Recommended**: <50% (Poor fit)

### Confidence Calculation

The system calculates confidence based on score consistency:

```javascript
const calculateConfidence = (skillsScore, experienceScore, culturalFitScore) => {
    const scores = [skillsScore, experienceScore, culturalFitScore];
    const mean = scores.reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0) / scores.length;
    const variance = scores.reduce((sum, score) => sum + Math.pow(score - mean, 2), 0) / scores.length;
    const standardDeviation = Math.sqrt(variance);

    // Higher confidence for more consistent scores
    const consistency = Math.max(0, 1 - (standardDeviation * 2));
    const confidence = Math.round((mean * 0.7 + consistency * 0.3) * 100);

    return Math.max(60, Math.min(95, confidence)); // Clamp between 60-95%
};
```

**Confidence Factors:**
- **Score Consistency**: More consistent scores = higher confidence
- **Average Score**: Higher average = higher confidence
- **Range**: Clamped between 60-95% for reliability

## Caching System

### Intelligent Caching

The system implements a 24-hour caching mechanism to optimize performance and reduce API costs:

```javascript
const getCachedAnalysis = async (candidateId, jobId, companyId) => {
    const cached = await prisma.aIAnalysisResult.findUnique({
        where: {
            unique_ai_analysis: {
                candidateId: parseInt(candidateId),
                jobId: parseInt(jobId),
                companyId: parseInt(companyId)
            }
        }
    });

    if (cached) {
        const cacheAge = Date.now() - new Date(cached.analysisDate).getTime();
        const maxAge = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 24 hours

        if (cacheAge < maxAge) {
            return {
                overall_score: cached.overallScore,
                skills_match_score: cached.skillsMatch,
                experience_match_score: cached.experienceMatch,
                cultural_fit_score: cached.culturalFit,
                verdict: cached.verdict,
                confidence: cached.confidence,
                reasoning: cached.reasoning,
                strengths: cached.strengths,
                weaknesses: cached.weaknesses,
                ai_model: cached.aiModel,
                analysis_date: cached.analysisDate
            };
        }
    }
    return null;
};
```

**Cache Benefits:**
- **Performance**: Instant results for repeated analyses
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduces OpenAI API calls
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent results for same candidate-job pairs
- **Reliability**: Fallback mechanism for API failures

## Error Handling and Fallbacks

### Robust Error Management

Each AI analysis component includes comprehensive error handling:

```javascript
try {
    // AI analysis logic
    const result = await openai.chat.completions.create({...});
    return {
        skills_match_score: parseFloat(result.skills_match_score),
        explanation: result.explanation
    };
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Skills analysis error:', error);
    return {
        skills_match_score: 0.5,
        explanation: "Unable to analyze skills due to AI service error"
    };
}
```

**Fallback Strategy:**
- **Default Scores**: Provides reasonable default scores when AI fails
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error tracking for debugging
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function even with AI failures
- **User Notification**: Clear error messages for transparency

## Performance Optimization

### Parallel Processing

The system processes all three analysis components in parallel:

```javascript
const [skillsAnalysis, experienceAnalysis, culturalFitAnalysis, strengthsWeaknesses] = await Promise.all([
    this.analyzeSkillsWithAI(candidateData.skills, jobData.requiredSkills, jobData.title),
    this.analyzeExperienceWithAI(candidateData.experience, jobData.experienceLevel, jobData.title),
    this.analyzeCulturalFitWithAI(candidateData, jobData, company),
    this.generateStrengthsAndWeaknesses(candidateData, jobData)
]);
```

**Benefits:**
- **Speed**: 3x faster than sequential processing
